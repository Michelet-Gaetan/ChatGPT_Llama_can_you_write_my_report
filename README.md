# ChatGPT_Llama_can_you_write_my_report

You'll find in this repository the research data obtained through the experiment described in the paper named "ChatGPT, Llama, can you write my report? An experiment on assisted digital forensics reports written using (Local) Large Language Models". You can use the data present in this repository as long as you cite the paper (it will be published in the DFRWS EU 2024 proceedings, and a complete reference will be provided once it is done).

The document named Comments_on_generated_texts.pdf provides a small summary of the quality and structure of the generated texts for each element (introduction, received items, methodology, conversation summary, and locations summary) and model (GPT3.5 and Llama2).

The document named The_Mandate.pdf is the mandate received by the investigator for this fictive investigation.

Then, the other documents provide the prompts submitted and the texts returned by the models. Their name follows this structure: Element_Model.pdf
